## Stable isotope tracers

Useful for examining the details of flows and processes, for example:

+ Carbon uptake and fractionation by different photosynthetic organisms (see [lecture](https://av02-ext.uca.es/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=20605)).
+ Nitrogen and carbon assimilation efficiency through food webs (see [lecture](https://av02-ext.uca.es/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=19910)).

## Tracing nutrient cycling - Natural tracers

Interpretting sources is complicated by overlapping, variable stable isotope values and the influence of biogeochemical processes.

+ Using multiple isotopes may help.
+ Test hypothesis with independant data sources.
+ Test hypothesis with further experiments.
    + Increase the difference in isotopic composition between source and sink.

--- .lightbg
## Where to find material with different isotopic compositions?

+ 'Man-made' nitrogen from fertilizer production; &delta;^15 N  ~ 0.
+ Biologically transformed N from effluent; &delta;^15 N  > 5.
+ Plant carbon; photosynthetic fractionation gives &delta;^13 C values between ~ -7 and -35.
+ Laboratory grade enriched stable isotopes; range of compounds and enrichment available.

## Adding stable isotope tracers

## Golden rules of isotope addition experiments

+ Aim for a **significantly different isotopic composition of the source, without a sig. different concentration (within 5 %).**
    + ^15 N relatively cheap, ^13 C relatively expensive.

+ Take isotopic composition measurements of the **medium** (i.e, water, biomass, DIN, DIC), **before** and **after** tracer addition.
    + Measurements are ideal (take plenty of samples), however inert tracers can also be used to give a good indication.

+ Take isotopic composition measurements of the **subject** (i.e, water, biomass, DIN, DIC), **before** and **after** tracer addition.    
    + Take plenty of samples (ensure good representation of 'natural abundance').
    + Consider non-linear sampling in time and space.

## Semi-closed systems

<div class="alert alert-info">
Incubation chambers, flume-tank, mesocosms, pilot plants, lakes, ponds, inter-tidal sediments.
</div>

+ Add tracer to **initial medium** at start of experiment.
+ Measure or calculate isotopic composition of the source.
    + Beware of changing concentration and isotopic composition of the source in time.
    + Using an inert tracer (Uranine, Bromide, ect.) can help define the initial concentration of tracer in systems with unkown or variable volume.

## Questions?

## Questions?
Isotope dilution can be an issue, particularily for closed systems or where there are highly active sediments. What is isotope dilution and what practical steps can be taken to avoid it?

*** .explanation
<span class='answer'>
**Isotope dilution is the change in atom fraction of the source pool with time**, which can lead to errors in uptake calculations. 

It is caused both by selective removal and import to the source pool (i.e., DIN). For example selective uptake of ammonium or release from biota.

Measuring the actual isotope composition of the source pool allows corrections to to be made. Reducing the length of incubations also helps.

## Collecting samples

+ **Completely seperate all handling and processing of labelled and non-labelled samples!**
+ Collect and process samples in the same way as for measuring elemental composition.
    + Take adequate steps to reduce cross-contamination; wash off excess medium, flush with 'clean' water, handle with gloves/tweezers.
    + Biomass and suspended matter samples should be weighed and dried to constant weight (freeze dried or 48h @60ºC).
       + Avoid high temperatures to avoid volatisation of C and N compounds.
       + Store frozen or dried (should have minor changes in isotopic composition).
    + Suspended material must be collected on inert filters; pre-combusted (4h @550ºC) or specially designed.    
    + Water samples should be processed as soon as possible; add compound to stop biological activity.
       + See [Sigman et al. 1997](www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420397000091) and [Lehmann et al. 2001](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac010212u) for details of DIN extraction.

--- .lightbg
## Preparing samples for analysis

+ Consider if interfering compounds can/should be seperated/removed.
    + Epiphytes on benthic macrophytes.
    + Calcium carbonate in suspended matter and sediments affects 13C measurments.
    + Mechanical and acid removal are options, although note there is a trade off as acidification may affect 15N values.

+ Ensure subject material is well mixed.
    + Grind organic material to a fine powder.
    + Assume material on filters represents a random sample.
    
+ For material trapped on filters consider checking if filters are really inert.

--- .lightbg
## Preparing samples for analysis

+ Optionally send samples for further processing to a certified laboratory (at a cost) or prepare them yourself and send.
    + Weigh (accuracy 0.001 mg) specified amount of sample and securely close in a specially designed 'tin combustion cup'.
    + Talk to the lab who will do the analysis, *before preparing the sample*.
    + Amount of material depends on the elemental content of the material.
        + For example see [Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory](http://www.isotope.nau.edu/submit.html)); ^15 N analysis of fresh plants (3% N content) 3.000 to 4.000 mg. 

--- .lightbg
## Preparing samples for analysis

+ **Not all labs will take labelled material!** Check possibilities and prices before starting experiment; expect to pay a little more for labelled material as it requires a different setup and excludes natural abundance measurements.

+ Finally, **shop around**; stable isotope samples travel well and are cheap to ship, hence look around for a lab that suits your price and turn-around time.

## Questions?

--- .lightbg &multitext
## Questions?
The price of ^13 C and ^15 N tracers are both relatively similar per gram.

1. What are the natural concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen (DIC and DIN) in water?
2. What is the approximate maximum amount of DIC and DIN tracer that can be added to the system?
3. Can  you explain why the costs of using each are so different?

*** .explanation
1. <span class='answer'>
The concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in water (DIC, 1000 - 4000 mmol/m3) is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, 1 - 100 mmol/m3).
</span>

2. <span class='answer'> Applying the 5% rule, we can estimate that the maximum tracer to be used is 20 x 0.05 = 1 mmol/m3 or ~ 14 mg/m3 of DIN and 2000 * 0.05 = 100 mmol/m3 or 1200 mg/m3 of DIC.
</span>

3. <span class='answer'> Allot more DIC tracer is required to 'increase the difference in isotopic composition between source and sink'.
</span>

*** .hint
Use the '5% rule' and the range of natural concentrations in aquatic systems.

## Tracer specific terminology and calculations

--- .lightbg
## Stable isotope-amount fraction or atom fraction

Previously called 'AP', 'Atom %'.

> Amount of a specified atom (isotope) (*n*) of a chemical element (E) divided by the total amount of atoms of the element within the mixture (P).

> $$x ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } = n ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{P}} / Σ n ( ^{k} \mathrm{E}) _{ \mathrm{P}}$$

For example, the $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ fraction, $x(^{15}\mathrm{N})$, of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was $x(^{15}\mathrm{N})_{\mathrm{DIN}}$ = 98 %.

For a full overview see @coplen_guidelines_2011.

--- .lightbg
## Mixing calculations

> Calculating the atom fraction of the mixture (P) of a tracer (T) and a medium (M).

> $$n ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } = n ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{T}} + n ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{M} }$$

> $$n ( \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } = n ( \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{T} } + n ( \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{M} }$$

> $$x ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } = n ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{P}} / n ( \mathrm{E}) _{ \mathrm{P}}$$


--- .lightbg
## Excess atom fraction

Also called excess (stable) isotope-amount fraction, previously 'atom percent excess', 'atom % excess' or 'APE'.

> Difference between the *mole fraction* of an isotope ^*i* E of element E in substance P and that of a reference. The superscript E signifies an excess quantity.

> $$x ^{\mathrm{E}} ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{P/reference}} = x ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{P} } - x ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{reference} }$$

For example, the excess atom fraction of plant above-ground biomass (AGB) compared to the reference atom fraction of dissolved inorganic nitrogen,  $x ^{\mathrm{E}} ( ^{15} \mathrm{N} ) _{\mathrm{AGB/DIN}}$ = 10 %.

For a full overview see @coplen_guidelines_2011.

--- .lightbg
## Uptake calculations

> Calculating specific uptake rate of the element (E) using the atom fraction of the 'source pool' mixture (P), sample excess atom fraction compared to the reference atom fraction of source pool (S/P), time of incubation (*t*) and biomass-specific element content (c).

> $$V ( \mathrm{E} ) _{ \mathrm{S} } = 
\frac{ 
x ^{\mathrm{E}} ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{S/P}}
}{
x ( ^{i} \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{P}} \times t
} \times c ( \mathrm{E} ) _{\mathrm{S}}$$

+ What element and range of concentration in system of interest?
+ Calculate amount of element required to increase concentration by 5%.
+ Calculate the 'maximum' cost of tracer, is it feasible?
+ Find natural abundance atom fraction values of subject; via datasets, literature and/or pilot study.
    + Extract mean and standard deviation.
+ Model uptake and calculate change in atom fraction required to be significantly different to natural abundance. What happens when the uptake rate and time are adjusted? What about the number of replicates?

--- .lightbg
## Analysing results

+ Convert all results to SI units (fraction rather than percent, mols ect.)
+ Calculate atom fraction of source pool mixture; either via an assumption of mixing, using an inert tracer or via measurement.
+ Test if atom fraction of reference and samples are sig different.
+ Calculate excess atom fraction of samples that are significantly different.
+ Calculate uptake.
